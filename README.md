# Minesweeper-React-Redux

This project is a React/Redux version of Minesweeper. Please see my 10 part screencast on Youtube where I built this project from the ground up.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running locally

You will need a local JavaScript development environment set up with yarn and npm. After cloning this repo, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the Minesweeper app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn lint`

Runs eslint against the project. Running `yarn lint --fix` will fix any erros that can but autofixed.


### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
